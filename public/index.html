  <p id="mainText">After the tragic events in Charlottesville, VA last August, conversations started happening in Franklin about how our city would (or would not) react if something similar happened here. In a lot of ways, our city is like Charlottesville. These discussions led to the thought that it would be better to be “actionary” instead of “reactionary.” The result of these conversations led to the idea that instead of taking down historical markers, what if we added to them and told a     “fuller story.” Further, it was believed that the CHURCH in Franklin should lead this effort.<br><br>Over the course of this past year we have initiated further dialogue between<br></p>
  <p id="listItems">…pastors and church leaders.<br>…the historical community in Franklin and Williamson County.<br>…the city administrator, city mayor and county mayor.<br>…the downtown business community.<br>…and a host of individuals.</p>
